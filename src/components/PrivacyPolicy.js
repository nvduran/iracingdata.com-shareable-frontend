                <h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
                <p>
                        When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain non-personally identifiable information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address,
                        time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, due to the usage of Google AdSense, other data such as user's interaction with
                        advertisements may be collected. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information”.
                </p>

                <h2>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
                <p>
                        We use the Device Information that we collect to calculate Monthly Active Users (MAUs) and to display targeted advertisements via Google AdSense. This helps us understand Site
                        usage and improve our services.
                </p>

                <h2>GOOGLE ADSENSE</h2>
                <p>
                        We use Google AdSense to display ads on our website. Google AdSense uses cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to our website or other websites. Google's use of
                        advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our site and/or other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of personalized
                        advertising by visiting Google's Ads Settings.
                </p>

                <h2>SHARING YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
                <p>
                        We do not share your Device Information with any third parties, except as necessary to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or
                        other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights. This does not include the sharing inherent in the use of Google AdSense.
                </p>

                <h2>YOUR RIGHTS</h2>
